      {
        question: "WHAT ARE LIQUIDATION PALLETS?",
        answer: "Liquidation pallets are part of the reverse logistics industry. Reverse logistics is when companies bid for direct contracts with retailers to acquire liquidation contracts. Liquidation contracts yield bulk merchandise which then resells to secondary retailers, wholesalers, or other resellers. This bulk merchandise is often bought by the pallet or gaylord."
      },
      {
        question: "What type merchandise can I buy by the pallet?",
        answer: "Our customers buy pallets of merchandise from over 100 different categories. Most of the items we carry are overstock or shelf-pulls. Some categories include: Pallets of Food/Candy, clothing and accessories, electronics, health and personal care products, home and garden supplies, sporting goods, outdoor gear and apparel, shoes, handbags and accessories, luggage and travel accessories, sports equipment, toys and games."
      },
      {
        question: "What makes Pallets Liquidation Center different from other liquidation companies?",

    ]
  },
  {
    category: "PAYMENT & SHIPPING",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How much does shipping cost?",
        answer: "Shipping costs vary based on location, pallet size, weight, and quantity. We offer competitive shipping rates and can arrange freight shipping for large orders. You can also arrange your own shipping or pick up pallets in person."
      },
      {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "We accept multiple payment methods including credit cards, bank wire transfers, Apple Pay, Bitcoin, and we also offer line of credit options for qualified customers. Payment is typically required before shipment."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer bulk discounts?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer progressive discounts for larger quantities. Truckload purchases receive the best pricing. Contact our sales team for custom quotes on bulk orders and ongoing supply agreements."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "MERCHANDISE QUALITY",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What condition is the merchandise in?",
        answer: "Our merchandise consists of customer returns, surplus inventory, shelf pulls, and overstock. Condition varies and may include new, like-new, and items with minor defects. Each pallet listing includes condition details."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I see what's in a pallet before buying?",
        answer: "We provide general descriptions and categories for each pallet, but specific item lists are not available as pallets contain mixed merchandise. This is part of the liquidation model that allows for low pricing."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer any guarantees?",
        answer: "While we cannot guarantee specific items or conditions due to the nature of liquidation merchandise, we stand behind our descriptions and work to ensure customer satisfaction. We're transparent about what to expect from our pallets."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "GETTING STARTED",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How do I start buying liquidation pallets?",
        answer: "To start buying liquidation pallets, browse our shop section, select the pallets you're interested in, and add them to your cart. You can purchase individual pallets or contact us for bulk pricing on truckload quantities. We recommend starting with smaller quantities to understand the merchandise before scaling up."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need a business license to purchase?",
        answer: "While not always required for individual purchases, we recommend having a business license for tax purposes and to establish wholesale relationships. For bulk orders and truckload purchases, a business license is typically required."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you help with business guidance?",
        answer: "Our experienced team can provide guidance on getting started in the liquidation business, including advice on profitable product categories, pricing strategies, and market insights. We want our customers to succeed."
